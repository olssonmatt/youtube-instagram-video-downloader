Love this question. You’re in exactly the right moment to level up if you play this well.

I’ll break this into **(1) which project to lead**, **(2) how to position yourself for a senior jump**, and **(3) how to run a model/scorecard rebuild like a senior analyst**—not just do the modelling.

---

## 1. Which model should you put your hand up to lead?

### Short answer: **Transaction model** (if you can handle the heat).

Fallback: **Everest** if Transaction is politically locked down.

### Why Transaction is the best lever for promotion

* **4 FTE = visibility + complexity**
  Management already knows it’s risky and resource-heavy. If you can *coordinate* this, you’re operating at senior level.
* **Upstream impact on Fusion**
  Anything that feeds Fusion is inherently high-stakes. Seniors get trusted with upstream dependencies.
* **Breadth over depth**
  Transaction models usually touch behaviour, usage, segmentation, stability, data pipelines—exactly what seniors are expected to understand.

> Promotion signal ≠ “I built the best model”
> Promotion signal = “I reduced delivery risk on something big and messy.”

### Why not Insolvency (yet)

* Too small (2 FTE).
* Often more niche, rule-heavy, and actuarial/legal constrained.
* Less leadership surface area.

### Everest?

* Solid middle ground.
* Good if Transaction already has a heavyweight lead.
* Still big enough (3 FTE) to show delivery and ownership.

**Ideal play:**
👉 Lead **Transaction**, *and* be the integration owner between Transaction → Fusion.

## 2. How to position yourself for a senior role (before you even start)

### Step 1: Explicitly ask for *scope*, not permission

When you speak to your manager or project lead, don’t say:

> “I’d like to help on Transaction.”

Say:

> “I’d like to **own delivery of the Transaction model rebuild end-to-end**, including stakeholder coordination and Fusion integration.”

That sentence alone reframes you.

### Step 2: Anchor your promotion case early

Ask this *before* the heavy lifting:

> “If I successfully lead this model rebuild, what would I need to demonstrate to be considered senior?”

Now you’ve:

* Made expectations explicit
* Tied the project to progression
* Forced them to see you as senior-adjacent

## 3. How a senior actually runs a scorecard/model rebuild

This is the part most intermediates miss. Seniors don’t just model—they **de-risk delivery**.

### Phase 0: Define success (most important)

Before touching data, write a **1-pager**:

* Business objective (e.g. risk separation, stability, Fusion uplift)
* Constraints (regulatory, explainability, timelines)
* Success metrics (AUC, KS, PSI, approval rate delta, override impact)
* Dependencies (data, other models, policy teams)

This is senior behaviour.

---

### Phase 1: Stakeholder & dependency mapping

You should know:

* Who owns Fusion decisions?
* Who signs off model methodology?
* Who owns data pipelines?
* Who will challenge the model (risk, audit, validation)?

Create a simple RACI—even informally.

> Seniors don’t wait to be blocked. They pre-empt it.

---

### Phase 2: Model strategy (before modelling)

Answer these early:

* Rebuild vs recalibration?
* Champion/challenger?
* Single score vs segmented?
* Variable stability vs predictive power trade-offs?
* Interpretability constraints?

Document decisions and *why*. This becomes gold during validation.

---

### Phase 3: Build like an adult (sorry 😄)

This is where you show maturity:

* Clean, reproducible code
* Clear feature lineage
* Variable grouping logic explained
* Thoughtful handling of missingness & drift
* Stability analysis across time & segments
* Not just “best AUC”, but **robustness**

If Fusion depends on it, stress-test hard.

---

### Phase 4: Integration thinking (where seniors shine)

Ask questions others won’t:

* How does Transaction interact with Everest & Insolvency?
* Are we double-counting risk?
* Does this change policy thresholds?
* What happens to marginal customers?

Bring these insights to meetings. That’s how you get remembered.

---

### Phase 5: Communication & narrative

You should be able to explain the model to:

* A validator
* A credit policy manager
* A non-technical exec

If you can’t do all three, you’re not senior yet.

---

## 4. How this turns into a promotion

By the end, you want your manager saying:

> “They basically ran this.”

Concrete promotion ammo:

* You led X FTEs
* You owned delivery of a Tier-1 model feeding Fusion
* You managed stakeholders & validation
* You reduced risk to timelines / outcomes
* You influenced credit strategy, not just modelling

That’s senior language.

---

## Final advice (real talk)

Don’t wait to be “ready.” Seniors are made by:

* Taking on **ambiguity**
* Making **decisions with incomplete info**
* Owning outcomes when things go wrong

If you want, next we can:

* Draft a **promotion-aligned development plan**
* Role-play the conversation with your manager
* Break down **what CTFS senior analysts are actually judged on**

You’re absolutely thinking about this the right way 👊
